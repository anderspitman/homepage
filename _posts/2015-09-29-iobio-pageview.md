Last night I decided to take a look at the site analytics for all the iobio web sites over the last 6 months. I've been getting a lot more emails lately - both good (collaboration inquiries) and bad (bug reports!) - so I figured that the usage must be up. And it is. Things have really taken off in the last several months and we are getting consistent growth in users as shown by the chart above.


<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
	One more interesting thing I found in google analytics was an animation showing the amount of new users (blue ball) and returning users  (green ball) and the amount of time they spend on the site over the last 6 months.

	You can see that the returning users spend more time on the site, which is not surprising since they are coming back to use it with a purpose. Also you can see that with the huge influx of new users, we are getting a steady growth of returning users. So it seems that a good percentage of people are sticking around.

	All in all we are really excited about the community response to IOBIO and are working hard on some new apps and getting out the alpha release of the dev kit!
