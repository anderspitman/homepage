We are releasing our second iobio app today, [vcf.iobio](http://vcf.iobio.io/). Vcf.iobio is a data QC app simliar to bam.iobio, but for variant data in the vcf format. Metrics such as allele frequency spectrum, TSTV ratio, variant quality distribution and more are calcuated for both remote and local files.
