# Announcing bam.iobio 2.0!

We're exciting to announce the launch of bam.iobio 2.0. This update represents
a major rework of the underlying code of the app, which is now using the Vue.js
framework. This new framework gives us much more leverage and flexibility when
adding features and fixing bugs.

As part of the update, we've also added several new features.

The most important are:
* Added a Get Help page
* Local CRAM support
* Overhauled read coverage chart

I'll highlight each of these below.


## Get Help page

First of all, you'll notice a "Get Help" button in the top right of the
app, on the navigation bar.

This button takes you to the brand new help
page.

The purpose of this page is to provide a way for users to report issues
without requiring any sort of account registration. Only an email address
is necessary. We hope that having a quick and direct line to the developers
will help our users resolve issues and make the experience better overall.


## Local CRAM Support
bam.iobio has supported loading CRAMs via url for a while now. However, when
loading files from your local hard drive, only BAM was supported. We
architected a new system that not only simplifies the way we load BAMs, but
also adds CRAMs as well.

## Improved Read Coverage Chart

Although the read coverage chart has always been front-and-center in bam.iobio,
it was somewhat barebones. That's no longer the case. Here's the old version:

And here's what what the same data looks like in the new version:

First, we added few nice visual cues for various situations. Chromosomes which
are in the header but don't have any reads are now grayed out, instead of just
missing from the chart (ie chromosomes 6, X, and Y above).  The chromosomes
also render as the data streams in, so you don't have to wait for everything to
download before seeing some results.

We added a horizontal line indicating the average coverage, as well as y-axis
labels showing approximate coverage values, and buttons for zooming the y-axis.

Importantly, we also fundamentally changed the way the chart is drawn. It used
to be a simple line chart, which sometimes made it difficult to interpret,
depending on the data. It's now essentially a bar chart with many small bars.
This makes it much easier to spot regions with 0 coverage, which show up
naturally as gaps. It also makes it simple to see things like copy number
variations (CNVs), as demonstrated in chromosome 7 below. Notice how the region
to the right of center has 1/2 the coverage, indicating a likely CNV here:

The new bam.iobio has already started rolling out. The process should complete
over the next few days. If you use bam.iobio and haven't been switched over
yet, you will be soon. We hope you like the new features. If you run into any
problems, please use the help page to get in touch with us!
